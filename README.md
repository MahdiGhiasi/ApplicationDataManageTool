# This version is stable ?
No, and I have no roadmap to make it stable.
I am working on this version for myself, I am testing only on one device with my applications.
If you find a bug you can report it or contribute to the project, I am not responsible for any damage.


## About this fork

I created this fork to make some small improvements for myself, but if you like this fork and you want me continue the development let me know so I can work to maintain this project.

# **Original readme:**

# Application Data Manage Tool
Application Data Manage Tool is a tool for Windows 10 Mobile devices to create backups from current state of apps and games, and restore them at a later time, or to another phone, or to your phone after a factory reset.

This tool helps you to create local backup archives from any of your apps and games; then you can copy them to your PC and then to any phone so you can restore that archive.

Additionally, you can reset the state of apps, which is almost the same as reinstalling them, but is faster  and also it can be done on some system apps (which you can't reinstall them)

*In order to use this tool, your device must be interop unlocked.*
